    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="description">There is nothing better than a hot plate of gooey, cheesy macaroni cheese to fill you up on a cold winter evening.This simple recipe will show you how to make the most delicious, cheesy and comforting macaroni cheese with just seven ingredients. <span class ="tip">PRO TIP: use cavatappi instead of macaroni for an even more delicious texture to the dish: the ridges and curls of this squiggly, hollow pasta take it to the next level.</span></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>Macaroni or Cavatappi - 250g</li>
        <li>Butter - 50g</li>
        <li>Plain flour - 50g</li>
        <li>Milk - 500ml</li>
        <li>Strong Cheddar Cheese, grated - 200g</li>
        <li>Salt - to taste</li>
        <li>English Mustard powder - 1 tsp</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol class="instructions">
        <li>Fill a large pan with hot water and add plenty of salt - the water should taste salty, almost like the sea. Bring to the boil.</li>
        <li>Once the water has boiled, add your pasta and cook according the the packet instructions. PRO TIP: you might want to shorten the cooking time by a couple of minutes because it will continue to cook under the grill later on. This will ensure that it remains al dente and delicious.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, strain but retain a couple of tablespoons of the starchy cooking water.</li>
        <li>While waiting for the water to boil, melt your butter in a small saucepan.</li>
        <li>Once the butter has melted, add the flour and the mustard powder and stir the mixture so that it becomes a thick, smooth paste.</li>
        <li>Cook the flour and butter paste for about a minute, stirring constantly, until it smells biscuity and has a slightly crumbly appearance.</li>
        <li>Add a splash of milk to the small saucepan and stir vigorously to avoid any lumps; the paste will thicken rapidly.</li>
        <li>Once the paste is smooth again, repeat the step above until all of the milk is used up. If the mixture is still very thick, you might need to add a little more milk. It should coat the back of a wooden spoon and the line should remain if you draw your finger across it.</li>
        <li>Heat the mixture until it is just below boiling point: don't let it boil!</li>
        <li>Add most of the grated cheddar and stir over the heat until it is completely melted and the sauce is smooth and silky. If there are any lumps, use a whisk or hand-blender to beat them out. Keep some of the cheese to one side (this will go on top of the dish before we put it under the grill).</li>
        <li>Add the reserved starchy cooking water from the pasta to the pasta and stir well. It should be shiny and separated, not dully and clumpy.</li>
        <li>Quickly add the cheese sauce to the refreshed pasta and stir well.</li>
        <li>Pour the pasta and cheese sauce mixture into a large, oven-proof dish and sprinkle over the remaining grated cheese. If you have any breadcrumbs and/or grated parmesan cheese hanging around, feel free to sprinkle on top of the grated cheese (this will add additional crunch and deliciousness).</li>
        <li>Put the dish under a hot grill and cook until the cheese is bubbling and golden and the macaroni cheese is hot all the way through.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with salad and/or garlic bread.</li>
    </ol>
