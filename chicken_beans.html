    <h1>Tarragon Chicken & Borlotti Beans</h1>
    <img src="assets/borlotti_beans.jpg" alt="Borlotti beans ready to cook">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This high protein, ultra-healthy dish is guaranteed to fill you up and leave you full of beans!</p>
    <p>Using juicy chicken thighs, fresh tarragon and thyme, and a squeeze of lemon, you will create a family favourite that is delicious at any time of the year.</p>
    <p>PRO TIP: removing the chicken while cooking the beans will keep the chicken tight and chewy for those who like to gnaw it from the bone - just make sure the chicken is cooked through and add back to the pan at the end to warm through. Leave the chicken in the pan if you like the flesh tender and falling off the bone.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Skin-on chicken thighs - 4</li>
        <li>Lemon - juice of half</li>
